      To be eligible for a refund, the course content must not be more than 20% completed. Refunds will not be issued for downloaded materials or in cases of account misuse.
      All refund requests must be submitted in writing via email with a valid reason. Our team will review the request and process approved refunds within 5â€“7 business days.
